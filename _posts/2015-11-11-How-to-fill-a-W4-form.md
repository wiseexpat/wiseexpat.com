title: How to fill a W-4 form

Most workers are subject to Federal Income Tax for their earnings each year. Depending on where you live you might also be subject to State Income Tax (an additional tax). The W-4 form is used by your employer to determine how much to withhold (deduct) from every paycheck towards your income tax bill for the year.

Filling the W-4 form incorrectly could lead to unpleasant surprises either in the form of a big payment when filing your taxes next year or -in some cases- to questioning by the IRS (if you claiming more allowances that you are entitled to).

<!--more-->

For that reason I'm going to analyze 4 different scenarios and explain how to fill the form on each case. **Note**: *Before submitting the form check with your Human Resources Department to ensure you're doing it correctly according to your particular scenario*. You can download the W-4 form [here][1]

# Scenario 1: Single Person, no children and one job

## Personal Allowances Worksheet
Allowances are tax breaks (concessions) that the IRS give you for you and your dependents. In this particular scenario and since you only have to support yourself and no other dependent (like spouse, children or relatives) this is the most straight forward case. The total allowances on line 5 of the *Employee's Withhold Allowance Certificate* should be 2 (A,B are filled with 1 the rest with 0).

## Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet
Deductions are expenses which are exempt from income tax, such as, interest paid on a mortgage. To simplify the process both for the individual and the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)][2], the IRS offers an standard amount called [Standard Deduction][3] in lieu of a more fine grained tax return using an Itemized Deduction that requires more work to be processed.

[Itemized deductions][4] *only* make sense if you have (or plan to have) tax exempt expenses on a fiscal year for more than the standard deduction. For most recently arrived expats this isn't the case and the standard deduction is the best option.

# Scenario 2: Married couple, no children and one job

## Personal Allowances Worksheet
In this case your family only have your job and you can claim your spouse as your dependent. Your total allowances on line 5 of the W-4 is 3 (lines A,B,C are filled with 1 the rest 0).

## Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet
Same as before for recently moved alien workers the standard deduction is the best option and in this case if you and your spouse file taxes jointly (one tax return for the entire family) you get double the amount of the single person's standard deduction. This is another incentive of the IRS to simplify the burden required to processes the taxes for the entire country.

# Scenario 3: Married couple, one child and one job

## Personal Allowances Worksheet
If you are the only one with a job and you have one children you can claim either 4,5 or 6 allowances depending on your salary. For instance, if you earn less than $100,000 you have two allowances for your child (under the *child tax credit*), if more than that but less than $119,000 you can only put one allowance and if more than $119k then zero.

## Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet
Same as Scenario 2.

# Scenario 4: Married couple, one children and two jobs

## Personal Allowances Worksheet
If your spouse is allowed to work and decides to, then you cannot claim him/her as a dependent so you have one less allowance. Now since both parents are working you can use *child care expenses* such as daycare to claim an additional allowance if the costs exceed $2,000 (which is the most common scenario). Also since you now have two income streams it is likely that you will be above $100,000 threshold so you won't be able to claim the two allowances for the *child tax credit* and you either end up in one or zero allowances.

## Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet
Same as scenario 2

## Two-Earners/Multiple Jobs Worksheet
This gets slightly more complicated as we now need to account for your spouse's salary. Let's assume your spouse's salary is $35,000 per year then you need to look into *Table 1* (on page 2) and you'd get five, that goes into line 2. Now since five is more than the number of allowances you have from the *Personal Allowances Worksheet* then you will fill zero on line 5 of the W-4 and need to calculate an additional amount to be deducted from your paychecks. That amount is calculated using the rest of the worksheet. Someone from Human Resources department needs to tell you how many pay periods are left in the year and you need to use that to calculate the additional amount on line 9. Once you have that you need you fill that number on line 6 of the W-4. For this scenario I assumed a salary of $75,000 and 15 pay periods left in the year.

# Conclusion
The tax code of the United States is very complex and in future posts I'll talk more in depth about it. But I hope this post helps you feel more confident filling the paperwork on your first day at your new job.
