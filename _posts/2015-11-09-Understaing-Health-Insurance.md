|Employee + Family - Contribution (per pay period) |$150    |$225    |

This is your typical health insurance summary sheet and I remember how little sense it made to me the first time I saw one of these. So I'm going to break it down for you.

## Deductible
It is the accumulative amount you have to pay before your insurance kicks-in. Let's say you go to the doctor and the treatment you need costs $2,000. If you select for the Standard plan you will have to pay that amount entirely from your pocket, but if you elect for the Premium you will pay $1,500 out of your pocket and the reminder $500 will be split between you and the insurance (see co-insurance bellow).

## Co-Insurance
Once you reach your deductible either by one payment that exceed the threshold or by the sum of multiple payments (e.g. multiple treatments) made during the current calendar year, then the expenses after that are split between you and the insurance with the specified ratios. Using the table above the ratios are 70% paid by the insurance company and 30% by you if you choose the Standard plan or 80% by the insurance company and 20% by you if you go with the Premium plan. Following the previous example for an expense of $2,000 with the Premium plan you would've paid an additional $100 ( 20% of $500) for that expense.

## Out of the Pocket Max.
This is the maximum amount you could pay for any given year for **all** health care expenses you incur, once you reach this level any sub-sequent expenses are covered 100% by the insurance company with no cost to you. For instance, let's say you have to have a treatment that costs $100,000 you will only pay $6,000 with the Standard plan and $3,000 with Premium plan.

## Copays
Copays are fixed amounts you have to pay every time you go to the doctor wether is a routine visit or if you go because you're sick. Copays are usually higher when visiting an specialist than when you go to your family doctor (a.k.a Primary Care Physician). Additionally, most insurance providers cover at 100% preventive care such as annual checks and in those cases you only responsible for paying the copay.

## Employee Contribution
This refers to the amount that gets deducted from your paychecks to pay for your health insurance. In the US most commonly you get a paycheck every two weeks so you have 26 paychecks per year. Also there's an additional amount you need to pay if you want to your family to be covered by your health insurance plan. Using the values from the table above you would pay $2600 per year ($100 * 26) for your individual coverage or $3900 per year ($150 * 26) to cover you and your family.

## In Network vs. Out-of-Network
Most insurance plans make distinctions between In-Network (Doctors that are affiliated with your insurance provider) and Out-of-Network (Doctors outside of the insurance provider's network), as a result insurance companies set higher thresholds for the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum when choosing non-affiliated Doctors. Nowadays it is very common for Doctors to be affiliated to multiple insurance providers and if you are offered any name brand provider chances are that your doctor will be affiliated.

## Vision and Dental Coverage
Most companies also offer a separate plans for Vision and Dental. These plans have their own deductibles and out of pocket thresholds independently from your health insurance. This means that any expenses, for instance, on a dentist visit won't go towards your health plan's deductible.

# Summary
To summarize, health insurance in the US is a multi-tier solution. The first tier before you reach to the deductible is paid to 100% by the employee, expenses after reaching the deductible are split between the insured and the insurance company, finally after you reach the max out of pocket the insurance company pays at a 100% for any expenses.
