**Welcome!** If you landed here and wondering what this site is about, I started this blog to share our journey of how my family moved to the US.

Moving to a different country can be very exciting but at the same time it can be overwhelming. As a newcomer you need to figure out the basics of how the country works and you need to do it in a short amount of time and I hope my experience helps you understand a little faster and avoid mistakes we made.

We arrived to Texas three years ago with a work visa and four bags. Fast forward three years we now have more junk and one of the best and richest experience of our lives so far but this isn't for everybody and you should account for the possibility that you (or anyone in your family) may not feel at home in a new country.

Most companies when they relocate somebody from overseas they want to make sure they get a return for their investment so it's common to make people sign contracts to ensure you stay with the company for an specific amount of time.  In our case we signed a two year contract and if we decided to return to our home country before that we'd pay back for all relocation costs.

Thinking on the possibility that we wouldn't enjoy being here I tried to minimize the company paid costs as much as possible so I wouldn't owe them money if we wanted to return. Thinking in retrospect that wasn't the best move as I ended up pretty much paying upfront for things that I'd only have to pay if we decided to retreat.

My message here is *be prepared*, it's crucial to keep an open mind and remove any preconception you may have before arriving to ensure you get the best out of this experience.

I want to hear other people's experiences and if you have an specific question or topic you want me talk about please write in the comments section below.
